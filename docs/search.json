His work aims to enhance our understanding of how these cognitive processes influence students’ academic performance and inform effective teaching strategies. His current interests involve the use of naturally occurring data to detect and understand behavior in online learning environments.\nOutside of the lab, Chris enjoys knitting and playing tennis. You can also find him playing around with computer code, listening to podcasts, or devouring a good book."
