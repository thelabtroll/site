    "text": "Chris is a 2nd year PhD student in Educational Psychology at the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities, with a profound interest in understanding how the mind encodes, retains, and retrieves information. In particular, he focuses on the ways in which people forget information intentionally, as well as how culture and collective narratives shape memory. In his spare time, Chris enjoys knitting and playing tennis."

    "text": "My research focuses on the interplay between learning and memory, and he is specifically interested in the “bright side of forgetting”. At both the individual and collective levels, forgetting processes shape the ways that we integrate information from our environment. Increasing our knowledge of these phenomena helps us to better understand how we learn and remember relevant information, which is key to academic success. With this information, we can improve students’ memory of course content and help them become better learners.\nOutside of the lab, Chris enjoys knitting and playing tennis. You can also find him playing around with computer code, listening to podcasts, or devouring a good book."
